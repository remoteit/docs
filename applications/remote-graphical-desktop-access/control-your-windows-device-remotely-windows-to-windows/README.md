# Control your Windows Device Remotely \(Windows to Windows\)

## Overview

Usually, establishing a remote connection between two Windows devices requires the insecure opening of ports on your internet router. With remote.it, however, it's possible to remotely control a Windows device quickly, securely, and without opening ports.

The remote.it Windows software application along with the Windows 10 built-in Remote Desktop \(RDP\), is all you need for this to work. 

Here’s a tutorial showing how to enable Remote Desktop in Windows 10 Home:

**NOTE:** Some editions of Windows do not support RDP.  In that case, you will need to use a different remote connection software, such as VNC. Here are a couple options:

TightVNC:

RealVNC:

Before we begin, please make sure that you have a remote.it account. If you do not have an account, please make one [**here.**](https://remote.it%20)

Additionally, download and install the remote.it Desktop Application on both Windows Devices. For information on how to do that, see this guide:

Finally, please ensure that both Devices are powered, awake, and connected to the internet.

Please follow the simple steps below to configure remote access:

1. Set the RDP remote access permissions on the target machine.
2. Register the target machine.
3. Create an RDP Service on the target machine. 
4. Connect remotely from another Windows Device.
5. Terminate the Connection.
