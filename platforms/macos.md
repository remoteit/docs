# MacOS

## Desktop App **for macOS**

The remote.it Desktop App for macOS allows for creating Services and connecting to Devices all in one app. 

Please, see our documentation on how to use our new Desktop application:

## **Peer to Peer connections** 

The desktop app is the easiest way to make P2P connections on Mac.

## SSH and VNC

Being able to SSH or VNC to a Raspberry Pi is now easier than ever using our Desktop app.
