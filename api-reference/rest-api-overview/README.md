# REST-API Overview

remote.it is powered by a robust set of APIs that allow you to do anything via an API that you can do with our [web portal](https://app.remote.it) or mobile applications.

Below are pages documenting our various APIs. It is best to start with the authentication docs since all other APIs require you to authenticate:

{% page-ref page="authentication.md" %}

{% page-ref page="devices/connect.md" %}

{% page-ref page="devices/device-connect-stop.md" %}
