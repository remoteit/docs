# Making connections

If you are using the remote.it web portal at https://remote.it to connect to your remote Devices, you do not have to install any software on your client PC, allowing you to use any computer with a browser and an internet connection.  This type of connection is called a "proxy" connection as the data passes through one of remote.it's proxy servers.

You can also install the remote.it App onto Windows or Mac computers, which lets you make Peer to Peer \(P2P\) connections.
