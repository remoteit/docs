 [remote.it](http://remote.it/) uses a certificate to allow encryption of your connection during the initial setup of your device. We can’t ask you to get a domain name and a certificate so we can communicate with your new device, so we have done that for you with a self-signed certificate. That means you will have to acknowledge it is OK to trust us and the self-signed certificate. If you are uncomfortable with this practice, or do not understand, you do not have to allow the connection.
