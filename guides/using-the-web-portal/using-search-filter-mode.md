# Using Search and Filter modes

The standard "View Devices" page in remote.it works well if you have up to a few dozen devices, but beyond that it becomes difficult to find a specific device without scrolling around.  Make your life easier by using the Search/Filter mode.

### Filter mode

Filter mode finds the entered string anywhere in the Device Name and is not case sensitive.  This mode is the default mode of your account.  

This shows the filter term "timer" matching "Timer-device":

This shows the filter term "device" matching a number of Device Names:

As you are typing in a Filter term, it does not become active until the third character you enter.

### Search mode

Search mode doesn't display any Devices until you enter the term which you wish to be matched in the Filter box.

First, you must go to Settings-&gt;Preferences in the navigation menu, and select the "Device Search" checkbox as shown:

When you return to "View Devices", note that no Devices are shown and the label of the text entry box has changed to "Search".

Search mode works a little differently than Filter mode.

* To match the search string at the beginning of the Device Name, just enter the search string.
* To match the string anywhere in the Device Name,  add an asterisk \(\*\) at the beginning of the search string.
* You have to press "Enter" after typing in your search term, to start the search.

 

Search for "timer":

Now let's search for "device":

We know that some Device Names have the word "Device" in them.  However this just shows that no Device Names begin with "device".  Since we want to match "device" anywhere in the name we add an asterisk to the beginning of the search term:
