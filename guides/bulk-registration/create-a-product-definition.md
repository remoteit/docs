Note: your Bulk Identification Code will be different from this one.  

With the Bulk Identification Code from the Product Definition, you can create one or more Bulk Registrations.  Typically a Bulk Registration might match a production run of Platforms.  The Bulk Identification Code needs to be written to each Platform that is part of a given Bulk Registration.  Follow the "Next" link below to learn how.
