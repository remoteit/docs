# Job Status

The Scripting page shows you the execution status of Device Scripts.

In the Job Status table you will see:

* The Script name
* Its overall status - one of new, running, done, or failed
* Report Status 
* Date and time the script was started
* Data and time the most recent update was received from any device
* Actions - a trash can so you can delete a completed Job, or a square that lets you Cancel a Job which is still running.
* The number of Devices in the Job
* The number of "Failure" messages received

It is important to understand that on the average it takes 3 minutes for Job Status to update.  So your script may actually complete and update the Status cells before the Job Status catches up.  It should respond and update within 3 to 4 minutes.
