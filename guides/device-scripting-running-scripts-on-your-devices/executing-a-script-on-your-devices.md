* If you do select this option, the Status Columns will update as messages arrive from your script, however you will not be able to select any other devices until this process has completed.
* If you don't select this option, status updates may be delayed slightly.

If your script uses commands to update the status columns,  make sure that "Show Advanced Columns" is selected:

As the script is executed on your group of Devices, it will fill in the Status cells as it proceeds.
