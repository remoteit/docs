# Configuring a webcam with Nx Witness

## Create an Nx Witness account

Your first step to setting up an Nx Witness enabled camera is to create an Nx Witness account. You can [signup for a free account here](http://www.networkoptix.com/).

## Setup on your device

Depending on the device you want to setup Nx Witness on, you will need to follow different guides. Here are a few guides from Nx Witness to get you started:

## Setup on Raspberry Pi

Since using a Raspberry Pi is so common on remote.it, we wanted to provide some even clearer steps on getting setup.

### Install Nx Witness

Now that you have your Nx Witness ARM ZIP file link, replace `<URL_TO_NX_WITNESS_ZIP>` in the below commands with that link and execute them on the command line of your device:

```bash
cd / 
sudo wget <URL_TO_NX_WITNESS_ZIP>
sudo unzip <NX_WITNESS_ZIP_FILENAME>
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Run Nx Witness

Now that you've installed Nx Witness you can run the media server with the following:

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/networkoptix-mediaserver start
```

### Start on boot

To have Nx Witness start when your device reboots, run the following command:

```bash
sudo update-rc.d networkoptix-mediaserver defaults
```

## Configuring your device

Now that you have Nx Witness running on your device, you need make sure your device is configured to connect to the Nx Witness service.

To do so, **create a new TCP service** using the remote.it connectd installer \(by running `sudo remotit` on the command line\) and **set the port to 7001**.
