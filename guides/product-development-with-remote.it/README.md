# Product development with remote.it

While remote.it is very useful if you have a few devices and you just want to connect to them occasionally, it is really suited for product development since it enables you to deploy products globally and be able to securely connect to them, run updates, debug problems and much more!

## Mass Registration

One of the many tools remote.it provides for companies developing products is what we call "Mass Registration" which makes it easy to install remote.it on thousands \(or millions!\) of devices while keeping manufacturing as simple as possible.
