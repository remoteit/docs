# Service types

_More detailed docs on remote.it supported service types are coming soon._

Virtually **anything that communicates over TCP** can be used with remote.it including:

* SSH
* VNC
* HTTP\(S\)
* Nx Witness
* RDP
* Samba
* TCP
* ...and much more!

{% hint style="info" %}
For service types that you don't see in the selection list, just _choose "TCP" as the service type_ and you can always configure the service type later in [the remote.it web portal](https://app.remote.it).
{% endhint %}
