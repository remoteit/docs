Available languages include English and Japanese and control the language used for notification e-mails.

Now, once your contact is a remote.it user, you can share and transfer devices to them.

### What happens if the contact does not already have a remote.it account?

Notice that for this Contact, the Account column indicates "no".  This means that the e-mail "name@e-mail.com" could not be found as a registered remote.it user name.  Until an account exists with the specified user name, sharing cannot be performed.

To invite this user to create a remote.it account, click on the "Create Account" icon:
