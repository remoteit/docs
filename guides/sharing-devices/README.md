# Sharing Devices

 You can share your registered remote.it Devices to one or more remote.it users.  This will allow them to make connections to any of the Services you have configured.  You can also choose whether the user\(s\) will be able to execute scripts on your device.  You \(or the other user\) can remove sharing at any time.

### How sharing status is shown in the Devices view
