* **Open at Login** - opens the Desktop App when you log in.  Note that Hosted Services and active Connections will keep running whether the Desktop App is open or not.
* **Search only device list** - select this option if you have a large number of Devices in your account.  You will then need to enter a search term to find the Devices and Services you wish to connect to.
